# Modding Guide
The following is a guide for modding using Starpoint.

## Installing Mods
1. If Starpoint is currently running, close it.
2. Navigate to the ``.cdn`` folder in the Starpoint installation directory.
3. If it doesn't exist, create a new folder inside the ``.cdn`` folder called ``mods``
4. Place the ``.zip`` for the mod that you are installing inside of this folder.
   - Do not extract the ``.zip`` file.
5. Start Starpoint.
6. The next time you connect to Starpoint, the mod will be downloaded to the game.

### Installation Notes
- **Initial Asset Download**
  - The initial asset download (~8GB / ~2GB) from a fresh game install will not include your mods.
  - After the initial asset download, restart the game to install your mods.
- **Uninstalling Mods**
  - Removing a mod from the ``mods`` folder will not remove it from your game.
  - The only way to fully uninstall a mod at the moment is to fully clear the game's app data.
